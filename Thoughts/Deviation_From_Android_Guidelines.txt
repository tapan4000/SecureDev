1) Android suggests to use the geofence API and activity recognition API for setting up the geofence notifications and for determining the activity (Walking, Running, InCar, OnBicycle) that the user is performing. However, we cannot use this logic as we plan to extend the services on GPS devices where the API's would not be available, so rudimentary logic of identifying the geofence or activity is used. That said, custom logic for geofencing uses a simple approach to calculate the existence within a geofence and checks are in place to make sure that the evaluation of geofencing activity is performed based on the facts like distance of the person from the geofence, if person has already been notified. Also, the app provides guidance on removing the geofences that are not used for a while and automatically removes them (if no action taken) within the threshold period.
