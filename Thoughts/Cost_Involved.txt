1) Google maps: Google maps gives $200 monthly credit to users. Extra needs to be paid. The costs are based on below
	a) Dynamic maps web loads: 28,500 times comes with $200 credit.
	b) Static street view web loads: 25000 times comes with $200 credit.
	c) Direction calls: 40000 times comes with $200 credit.
	d) Travel time and distance calls: 40000 times comes with $200 credit.
	e) Road Calls (Best fit road geometry based on GPS coordinates passed, or speed limits on a road): 40000 Places details calls come with $200 credit.
	f) Address auto-complete in search: 10000 calls come with $200 credit.
	g) Get a place from address, names etc: 10000 calls come with $200 credit.
	h) Dynamic/Static maps mobile loads: Unlimited
	i) Directions Advamced: 20000 times comes with $200 credit.
	j) Distance calls advanced: 20000 times comes with $200 credit.
	Basically two tiers exist in Tier 1(0-100K calls) the price per thousand would be $5 and for 100K+ calls it would be $4.

For address completion in google maps rate is
10K - $200
whereas in here maps the rate is
100K - $49
So, if google maps appear to be costly, will need to move towards here maps

As we may move to different map providers/address search provider keep the API clients pluggable.
