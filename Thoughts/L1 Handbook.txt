1) If a user has sent a group membership request to another person and the other person cannot see the request, it is possible that the other person might have blocked the user, however, the support person cannot disclose to the requestor whether the target user has blocked the requestor. He can only give the possible reasons for the target user not being able to see the request. Only when the target user calls, can the call center person tell the user if he/she has blocked the requesting user.
