1) When we place the ethernet module on top of arduino, the image taking software(host app) receives the bytes however the image is not displayed in the window.
2) When we use the ethernet shield, we need to use the chip select port as 7 instead of 10 (in UNO). Then we get the starting and ending bytes properly.
3) If arduino is low on RAM, the file open fails on SD card. Even on RAM size of 261 the failure happens. There are other unexpected issues that also start happening.
4) Arduino Mega does not start up if we use Serial.begin(921600). Instead we can set the value as 115200 or a value higher than 921600
5) If we put breakpoints in the Arduino code neae Serial.begin, there are chances that the Arduino serial buffer gets overflown with debug information. In such cases it start showing the error _VMDPE. To fix this, remove the breakpoints and upload the code.
