1) When we place the ethernet module on top of arduino, the image taking software(host app) receives the bytes however the image is not displayed in the window.
2) When we use the ethernet shield, we need to use the chip select port as 7 instead of 10 (in UNO). Then we get the starting and ending bytes properly.
