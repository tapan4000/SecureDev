Day 1
7:03 -> 8:27 (every 30 sec)
For above interval---
7:33, 7:46, 7:52, 7:59, 8:11, 8:24 (change of position occuring at these times, so the change happens variably at 13min, 6min, 7min, 2min etc)
------
9:09 onwards -> (time period, 30sec, 1min, 2min, 4min, 5min, 7min) 9:30 -> 10:10 (ran every 30 seconds), 10:33-> 11:31 (every 30 sec), 1:30 -> 2:45 (every 30 sec)

For above, Change of position happened at below times:
9:14, 9:22, 9:28, 9:31, 9:36, 9:39, 9:43, 9:47, 9:52, 9:57, ----11:11, 11:16, 11:26, 11:31---11:46, 11:49, 11:59, 12:11, 12:17, 12:23, ---- 4:04, 4:08, 4:11(consecutive 30sec has same location), 4:23
So, change of position happening in 8min, 10min, 5min, 4min, 3min, 2min

Day 2:

Itinerary:
8:07 - Move charging away
8:38-9: Commute to office
9:10 - Check phone
10:10, 2pm - check phone
4:07 - starting from office

-----
7:25 -> 8:34 (every 30 sec update with location also updating every 30 sec as the vehicle was moving and correct trajectory being shown)
10:10 -> 10:19 (every 30 sec update)
10:30 -> 11:27 (every 30 sec update, with variable 3, 5, 10 min interval update of location)
16:07 -> 16:24 (update happen every 30 sec, however, the location update happened in 30sec, 2min, 4min, so even while moving no guarantee of getting update every 30 sec)

Day 3 (Optimize battery both options)
6:32 - Start

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Day3:
On Day 2 testing the freeze application battery optimization was removed.
On Day 3 testing both free application and optimize when abnormal was removed. However, still the observation is similar to the observations on Day2. No change of behavior.
On Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 we used get current location every 30 seconds using the handler with post delayed.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Day4:
On Day 4 testing, the freeze application battery optimization was removed.
Additionally, locationupdate callback is used with interval of 30 sec and fastestinterval of 30 sec.
It is seen that the location trigger is happening every 30 sec , 1 min, or 1:30 min. Most of the time the location is updated every 1 min. This is more trustable source than using handlers in terms of period of trigger. The actual location update also happens every 30sec or 1 min interval. On very few instances the location update is happening at 2min, 10 min etc.
