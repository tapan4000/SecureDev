1) WorkManager can be used for scheduling a task as it acts as a wrapper above Job Schedulers, FirebaseJobDispatcher, AlarmManager+BroadcastReceivers, so we need not manager API version. Otherwise we had to use Job schedulers for API version > 21 and FirebaseJobDispatcher with API > 14 and google play services enabled. WorkManager checks if API > 21, use Job schedulers, else if API > 14 and google play services are available use FirebaseJobDispatcher else use AlarmManager+BroadcastReceiver. WorkManager and underlying schedulers have limitation that the job can be scheduled for every 15 minutes at a minimum.
2) AlarmManager is used with setExact timer as emergency situations will be used to fetch the location and where exact timing would be important for people to track their loved ones. setExact has been discouraged, however, person's security requires this feature. This feature is used only in scenarios where an emergency is being notified. Additionally, this alarm is set to a near future time like 5 minutes future and thereafter till the user wishes to track the victim.
